# Marital Infidelity

The aim of my project is to determine the predictors of marital infidelity. Couples therapists view extramarital affairs as one of the most damaging relationship events and 
one of the most difficult problems to treat in couples therapy. Furthermore, a review of 
ethnographic accounts of conjugal dissolution across 160 societies found that infidelity was the 
single most common cause of marital dissolution. Rather than seeking couple therapy when 
extramarital affairs happen, can we predict the factors of extramarital affairs? If so, we may help 
prevent marital affairs from happening. The aim of the current project is to determine the 
predictors of extramarital affairs. To tackle this project, I utilized Fairâ€™s Affair data set. It 
featured 10 columns and 601 rows. Some notable features were frequency of affairs, gender, age, 
years married, and religiousness. After running a correlation matrix, the significant predictors 
for my model were years married, religiousness, and happiness rating. Both in training and 
testing, the model did not perform well with the predictors chosen from the correlation matrix.
